# CSS Refactoring Tasks

- [ ] Define CSS custom properties (variables) at root for colors, spacing, border-radius, etc.
- [ ] Replace fixed pixel units with relative units (rem) for better scalability
- [ ] Implement logical properties (margin-block, padding-inline) for consistency
- [ ] Update selectors and properties throughout to use variables and modern units
- [ ] Improve responsiveness with better media queries and clamp() for fluid sizing
- [ ] Organize CSS with consistent commenting and grouping
- [ ] Ensure design appearance remains intact
